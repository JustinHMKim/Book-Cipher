# Book-Cipher
A basic version of a Book Cipher in C++

Takes alphabetical characters, spaces, quotes (single and double), and '-' as inputs. 

Allows for encryption/decryption with portions from Frankenstein, 1984, and Crime and Punishment. 

Explanations on Book Ciphers and the basic operations of this implementation are included within. 

WIP:
1. Expanding on the option to decrypt the encrypted messages, making it possible to tease the plaintext out.
2. Adding hints to cracking a book cipher.
