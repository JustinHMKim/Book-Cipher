# Book-Cipher
A basic version of a Book Cipher in C++

Takes alphabetical characters, spaces, quotes (single and double), and '-' as inputs. 

Allows for encryption/decryption with portions from Frankenstein, 1984, and Crime and Punishment. 

Explanations on Book Ciphers and the basic operations of this implementation are included within. 

Some premade ciphertexts are available if one wants to try and brute force them, just as an illustration on the effectiveness of the cipher.
